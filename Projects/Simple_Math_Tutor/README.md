### Original Task
Ask the user for two numbers and then display the sum of the numbers.

<pre>
SOLUTION:

num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())

print("{} + {} = {}".format(num1, num2, (num1 + num2)))
</pre>

### Project Refactor
Rather than display the answer to simple mathematical operations, the user will enter the operands and select the operation to perform, and then will also input their computed answer. If they are correct The program will then tell the user whether the answer they entered was correct or incorrect and then give them two more tries before giving an explanation of the correct answer.
