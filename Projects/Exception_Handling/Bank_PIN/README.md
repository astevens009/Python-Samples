## Exception Handling

We need to create a program that allows users to create their own PIN codes for their bank cards. Each PIN code consists of digits. Complete the program so that when the user enters a character, the program stops and outputs "Please enter a number" and when the user enters only digits, the program outputs
PIN code is created".

<pre>
<strong>Sample Input</strong>
44a5

<strong>Sample Output</strong>
Please enter a number

<strong>HINT</strong>

Recall int() function, that occurs an error when the argument is not a number.
